The initial full version was released in 2013, and the database was updated to its current version in 2021.\nThe format of the data is geometry data based on census block groups. We plan to select the features that can best describe our research question, and select the data falls into Manhatten area in New York city. We plan to plot the density distribution of the data to examine the usability of the features for future use.",

Similarly, Very High D1C and Very High D3B also have a dense cluster, suggesting that regions with high employment density tend to align with higher street intersection density.\nHowever, the spread of points increases for Medium and High categories, indicating greater variability or inconsistency in these regions. This implies a potential correlation between employment density and street intersection density, but variability exists in intermediate categories.\n\n\n3.2.5 (5).

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nOur analysis shows that Manhattan’s most centrally located areas are concentrated in Midtown, which is consistent with the district’s role as a center for business, transportation, and cultural attractions. These areas are examples of urban centrality because of their extensive roadway system and close access to important transportation options. In addition to being centers of activity, they also show how accessibility and urban design can interact powerfully.\nA major discovery of this project is that jobs within 45 minutes auto travel time (D5AR) have a significant impact on regional centrality, outweighing other factors like transit access, urban design, and demographics. The relationship between regional centrality and the amount of jobs within 45 minutes highlights how opportunities impact a city’s functional center.",

The primary motivator is destination accessibility, but the interaction of other factors shows an complicate structure of interactions that needs further study. Moreover, diverse patterns of centrality show variations in the density of street intersections, suggesting that regional factors may have an impact on how accessibility converts into centrality.",
