    "text": "1 Introduction\nUnderstanding the efficiency of locations is becoming increasingly important in an era of rapid urbanization and growing interest in sustainable living. The Smart Location Database is a valuable resource for understanding the intricate relationships that exist between transportation systems, urban planning, demographic trends, and centrality. This national dataset gathers more than 90 characteristics and provide a comprehensive picture of location efficiency, including employment possibilities, transit service, neighborhood design, land use diversity, housing density, and even demographic trends. Additionally, it offers information at census block groups level, providing an enormous amount of data for scholars, decision-makers, and urban planners.\nIn this study, we focus on Manhattan, New York City because Manhattan offers an exceptional case for analyzing the complex factors influencing location efficiency and urban sustainability.\nThrough this analysis, we want to answer these two questions:\n\nWhat role does urban factors play in influencing the centrality index of urban areas in Manhattan?\nCan we identify trends in employment possibilities, transit service, urban demographics, and housing density in Manhattan and provide recommendations for urban planning or transportation infrastructure improvements?\n\nBy focusing on Manhattan, we intend to provide insightful information that can promote equitable growth, improve the quality of life for its citizens, and improve equity. Join us as we investigate Manhattan’s story from the Smart Location Database!",

The initial full version was released in 2013, and the database was updated to its current version in 2021.\nThe format of the data is geometry data based on census block groups. We plan to select the features that can best describe our research question, and select the data falls into Manhatten area in New York city. We plan to plot the density distribution of the data to examine the usability of the features for future use.",

Higher street intersection density levels (e.g., “Very High”) exhibit more compact clustering along the trend line, indicating better regional centrality and job accessibility. Lower levels of employment density (D1C) are more scattered, particularly in the “Low” street intersection density category.\nThe Employment density does not seem to significantly influence the observed relationship in this data.",
