Smart Location
Understanding Location Efficiency and Urban Centrality in Manhattan
# Overview
This repository explores location efficiency and urban centrality in Manhattan, New York City, using data from the Smart Location Database (SLD). The rapid urbanization and growing interest in sustainable living make it crucial to understand the relationships between transportation systems, urban planning, demographic trends, and urban centrality.

The project aims to provide insights that can promote equitable growth, improve quality of life, and enhance sustainability through data-driven urban planning recommendations.

# Research Questions
This study is centered around two primary research questions:

1. What role do urban factors play in influencing the centrality index of urban areas in Manhattan?
2. Can trends in employment opportunities, transit service, urban demographics, and housing density be identified to provide actionable recommendations for urban planning or transportation infrastructure improvements?
By answering these questions, we aim to shed light on the intricate factors shaping urban sustainability in Manhattan.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the Smart Location Database (SLD) provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The SLD gathers over 90 indicators related to the built environment and location efficiency, including:

transit access
urban density
urban design
urban demographics
urban destination

# Key Features of the Dataset:
Format: Geometry data based on Census Block Groups (CBG)
Scope: Data covers the entire U.S., but we focus on Manhattan, NYC.
Size: Over 90 variables, with 32 selected for this analysis across five perspectives: demographics, density, design, transit access, and destination accessibility.

# Objectives
Data Exploration and Usability:
Focus on Manhattan data and examine the density distribution of selected features to evaluate their usability.
Analysis and Visualization:
Identify trends in the selected features and their relationship to urban centrality.
Recommendations:
Provide actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers based on the findings.

# Methodology
Data Selection: Extract Manhattan-specific data from the SLD dataset using geometry-based filtering for Census Block Groups.
Feature Engineering: Focus on the 32 selected features to align with the research questions.
Data Visualization: Plot density distributions and analyze feature usability for centrality and location efficiency metrics.
Analysis: Investigate relationships between urban factors (e.g., employment, transit, demographics) and centrality indices.
